That's an excellent and very practical question. Based on the Master Plan we've laid out, the game will become **decently playable at the end of Phase 8**.

Let's break down why:

### The "Decently Playable" Milestone: The End of Act II

"Decently playable" means a user who isn't a developer can pick up the game, understand the basic goals, play for 15-20 minutes, and have a complete, satisfying (though short) experience. This is often called a **"Vertical Slice"** or a **"Gameplay Slice."**

Here's a snapshot of what the game looks like at the end of each act to illustrate this:

---

#### **End of Act I (End of Phase 4): A Tech Demo**

*   **What you have:** A sandbox full of working features.
*   **What a player experiences:** They can create a character and are dropped into a world. They can walk around and see that NPCs exist. They can interact with an object and see a dialogue box pop up. They can see their stats on the screen.
*   **Is it "playable"?** **No.** It's a collection of impressive technical features, but there is no *game* yet. There is no goal, no story, no reason to do anything. It would be like being in a car where the engine, steering wheel, and radio all work, but they aren't connected to each other.

#### **End of Act II (End of Phase 8): A Playable Vertical Slice**

*   **What you have:** All the features from Act I are now **integrated and working together** to create a complete gameplay loop.
*   **What a player experiences:**
    1.  They start a **New Game** and go through the **Character Creation** process.
    2.  They spawn in a fully designed **Hostel Room**.
    3.  They see the **in-game clock** is running, and their **Energy** is slowly draining.
    4.  They can leave their room, walk through the connected **Hostel Hallway**, and go to the **College Campus**.
    5.  On campus, an NPC (let's say a Professor) has a "!" over their head. The player talks to them.
    6.  The Professor gives them their first **Quest**, complete with dialogue and meme sound effects. The quest appears in their **Quest Log**.
    7.  They complete the quest's objective (e.g., picking up an item in the library).
    8.  They return to the Professor, who gives them a reward (**Money** and **XP**).
    9.  They can go to a **Shop** (like a vending machine) and use their new money to buy an item.
    10. As night falls, they return to their room, **Sleep** in their bed, which advances the day and **saves the game**.
*   **Is it "playable"?** **Absolutely, yes.** This is a complete, albeit short, game. It has a beginning (character creation), a core loop (managing time/energy while doing quests), a goal (completing the quest), and an end state for the session (sleeping/saving). This is the point where you can give it to a friend and they will understand how to play your game.

#### **End of Act III (End of Phase 12+): A Finished Game**

*   **What you have:** The complete, polished experience.
*   **What a player experiences:** Everything from the vertical slice, but now there are dozens of quests, a full story that progresses from Age 16 to 26, multiple endings, a balanced economy, and a high level of polish with extra sound effects, UI transitions, and special effects.
*   **Is it "playable"?** Yes, it's the **final product**.

**In summary:**

Your target for having a version of the game that you can proudly show to someone and say "Here, play this," is the **completion of Phase 8.** Everything after that is about adding more content, story, and polish to that solid, playable foundation.
